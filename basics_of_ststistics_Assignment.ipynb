        "  - **Qualitative Data**: This type of data refers to non-numeric data that can be categorized or described based on attributes or characteristics. For example, colors, gender, or types of fruit (e.g., apple, orange, banana).\n",
        "  - **Quantitative Data**: This type of data refers to numerical values that can be measured or counted. For example, height, weight, age, or income.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - **Mean**: The arithmetic average of a dataset, useful when data is symmetric and lacks outliers.\n",

        "  - **Median**: The middle value when data is ordered, useful when the data is skewed or contains outliers.\n",
        "    - Example: For the dataset {1, 3, 3, 6, 7}, the median is 3.\n",
        "  - **Mode**: The most frequent value in a dataset, useful for categorical data or identifying common values.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - **Variance**: Measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean, quantifying the spread of data. A higher variance means more spread.\n",
        "    - Formula: \\(\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\mu)^2}{n}\\)\n",
        "  - **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, giving a measure of the spread in the same units as the data.\n",
        "    - Example: A dataset with higher variance or standard deviation indicates that the values are more spread out from the mean.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - A **box plot** is a graphical representation that shows the distribution of a dataset through its quartiles. It highlights the median, the interquartile range (IQR), and identifies outliers.\n",
        "  - It provides insights into the central tendency, spread, and potential outliers in the data.\n",
        "    - The **box** represents the interquartile range (IQR), the **line** in the box is the median, and **whiskers** extend to show the range of data. Outliers are plotted separately.\n",

        "### 5. **How does random sampling contribute to making inferences about a population?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - **Random sampling** involves selecting individuals from a population in such a way that each individual has an equal chance of being chosen. This helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population, reducing bias. This allows researchers to make valid inferences or generalizations about the population based on the sample.\n",

        "### 6. **What is skewness, and how does it affect the interpretation of data?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - **Skewness** refers to the asymmetry of the data distribution.\n",
        "    - **Positive skew (Right skew)**: Data points are clustered on the left, with a long tail on the right.\n",
        "    - **Negative skew (Left skew)**: Data points are clustered on the right, with a long tail on the left.\n",
        "  - Skewness can affect the mean, which is pulled in the direction of the skew. In skewed distributions, the median is often a better measure of central tendency than the mean.\n",

        "### 7. **What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - The **IQR** is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of a dataset, i.e., \\( \\text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 \\). It measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "  - **Outliers** are typically defined as any values that are more than 1.5 times the IQR above Q3 or below Q1. This helps to identify extreme data points.\n",

        "    1. There are exactly two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
        "    2. The trials are independent.\n",
        "    3. The probability of success is constant for each trial.\n",
        "    4. The number of trials is fixed.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - The **normal distribution** is symmetric, with the mean, median, and mode all equal. It is bell-shaped and defined by its mean and standard deviation.\n",
        "  - The **empirical rule (68-95-99.7 rule)** states:\n",
        "    - 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation from the mean.\n",
        "    - 95% falls within 2 standard deviations.\n",

        "- **Answer**:\n",
        "  - A **Poisson process** models the number of times an event occurs in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",

        "  - A **random variable** is a variable whose value depends on the outcome of a random event.\n",
